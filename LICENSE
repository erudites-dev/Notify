Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free software license. It is designed for software libraries, but it can also be applied to other kinds of software.

You may use, distribute and modify this software under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This license ensures that you can freely use, modify, and share the software while requiring that improvements or derivative works remain under the same license if distributed.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and “the GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, you may distribute your modified version under the terms of this License, provided that you also meet all of the following conditions:

The modified work must itself be a software library.

You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

You may create and distribute an Application that uses material from the Library header files under terms of your choice, provided that:

You give prominent notice that the Application is using the Library and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

The object code you distribute is combined with the Library such that users can modify or replace the Library and relink to produce a modified version of the Application.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also meet the following conditions:

Give prominent notice that you use the Library and that it is covered by this License.

Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this License.

License the Combined Work under terms that permit modification of the Library portion and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work separate from the combined library, also covered by this License.

Give prominent notice that part of it is based on the Library and covered by this License.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Library specifies that a certain numbered version of the LGPL “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

To apply the GNU Lesser General Public License to your work, attach the following notices to the library.
It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;
and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full license text is found.

    Notify - Notify is an intuitive administrative utility that enhances server communication through high-visibility gradient announcements, instant system alerts, and a streamlined staff-call system.
